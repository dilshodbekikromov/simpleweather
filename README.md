# Simple-Django-Weather-App
A simple django app telling the current weather of any location. I used a free api from https://openweathermap.org/



class FullStackDev:

    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Dilshodbek Ikromov"
        self.role = "Full stack developer"
        self.language_spoken = ["en_US"]

    def say_hi(self):
        print("Thanks for dropping by, hope you find some of my work interesting.")


me = FullStackDev()
me.say_hi()
